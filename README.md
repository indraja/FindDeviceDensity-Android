# FindDeviceDensity-Android
In android, It is really hard to maintain the UI for different resolutions. Though we know that by adding the resources in different res folders like mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi etc can solve the problem, It is hard to find whether the testing device is hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi or etc. This app finds the device density and displays a text.
